# glyvis: Fast Visualization For Glycoverse

Provides a unified interface for visualizing glycomics data within the
'glycoverse' ecosystem. Implements 'autoplot()' methods for various data
structures including statistical results from 'glystats', experimental
data from 'glyexp', and glycan structures from 'glyrepr'. Designed for
rapid data exploration and quality assessment rather than
publication-quality figure generation.
